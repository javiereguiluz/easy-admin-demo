# There are two main techniques to fully translate a backend:
# 1) Define the `label` option for each element and translate those labels in
#    files like this.
# 2) Let the backend create the labels for each element and translate those
#    labels in files like this.
#
# The first one is the traditional way of translating Symfony applications, but
# is very boring and you'll make lots of mistakes. The second one is the way we
# recommend to translate backends.
#
# Both ways are explained in https://github.com/javiereguiluz/EasyAdminBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/tutorials/i18n.md

# NOTE: since the application is originally developed in English, this
#       "translation" file looks useless because it doesn't really translate
#       any content. However, this file is essential to use it as the base for
#       the translations into other languages.

# The "main menu" is an example of defining the labels explicitly
# (they are translated following the 1) method)
