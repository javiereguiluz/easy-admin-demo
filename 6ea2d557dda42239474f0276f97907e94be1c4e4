Great üëè  Thanks a lot! I've installed and it looks nice. I've only seen some very minor issues in some pages. I'll review with more detail later!

@javiereguiluz Thanks. I think we should also move this repository to @EasyCorp. WDYT?
A working online demo to show some cool features of the bundle would also be appreciated.
